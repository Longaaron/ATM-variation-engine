# ATM-variation-engine
 This project has been carried out during the summer of 2020. The summer of 2020 has proved to be one of the most challenging summers of recent times due to the ongoing pandemic which has affected people throughout the world in their respected fields.
 
 The aim for this project was to implement Apache Maven. Maven has helped us with the creation and management of the project, allowing us to make a complex engine that would act as an atm. The JAVA programming langauge was key throughout the development of the project as it allowed us to develop objects around certain goals that we aimed to achieve.
 
 Finally, the introduction of JUnit was key to find any bugs or errors within the code itself. Test cases were created and interfaces were tested to make this project build and run smoothly.
